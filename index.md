### CPSC 120

* Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about how many days has passed since the last time I've done something.  I was about to write a program that calculate that for me, including the extra day in the leap year.  Now I can just fire up this bad boy and viola! it tells me exactly have many days has gone by. 

* Lab 7, part 2 was another favorite because blackjack is one of my favorite game.  I always play a few hands everytime I am visiting Las Vegas.  Being able code and calculate each card value is an interesting experience.  

* Lab 6, part 2 was another fun project and a favorite project.  This is a game I could play when I am bored in a classroom.  It seems like I am working on something but instead, I am just playing a simple game I created in CPSC 120.
